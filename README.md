*DESCRIPTION*: 
              In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of rainfall using weather-related features such as humidity, fog, wind, and wind speed. The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed to identify key factors influencing rainfall. I used the Random Forest algorithm due to its robustness and accuracy in handling classification tasks with complex patterns. The model was trained and evaluated to determine its effectiveness in predicting rain vs. no rain. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning in weather forecasting applications.
